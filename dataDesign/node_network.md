A [[node]] network is a combination of [[node]]s and [[link]]s.
[[link]]s connect [[node]]s, it's a glue binding data together.
It's much of roads ([[link]]) and houses ([[node]]), we can use some set of roads to drive to some house.

In the same way, starting at some [[node]] we can navigate to another [[node]] in the same [[node_network]] following the [[link]]s in that [[node_network]].
