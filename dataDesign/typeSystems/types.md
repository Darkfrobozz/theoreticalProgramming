To provide easy reading and recognize errors early on, we can sort data by types.

This allows us to recognize when the type expected does not match the type entered.
Consequently, we can catch errors where we forget what form the data has.

Examples of types are strings, integers and floating point numbers.

Each of these have different data representation so when we put an integer into a function handling strings, it will not represent anything meaningful to the computer.
