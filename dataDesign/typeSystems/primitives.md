In programming language, some [[types]] are often for free.
For example, in C, *int*s and *double*s are not defined by the user, rather they are already there.
These are called primitive types.

These types are usually then used in conjunction to create the programmers own types, often refereed to as composite types since they usually use the primitive types to create their own type out of.
For example, in C, one can make a type *intDoublePair* for a struct that has an *int* and a *double*, this is a composition of those two types.
