This concept is often misconstrued with the [[static_vs_dynamic]] and that is because the concept is itself very vague and is not recommended for use.
It is however often associated with ideas that symbolize strength of [[types]] in some language.

However, one way to define the concepts has been to set weak typing as the ability in the programming language to switch between different types of a data piece, the ability to for example turn an integer into its string representation by simply treating it as a string.

The negative part is how a type is converted is not always as clear as the integer example.
For example, how do we convert an integer to a tree type?
Even more problematic is that the programmer will need to design their own conversion if they implement their own types beyond the [[primitives]].
