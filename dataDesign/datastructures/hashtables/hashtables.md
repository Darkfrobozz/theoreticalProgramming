A hashtable is a datastructure meant for quick lookups and inserts, it works much like an array.
However, while an array uses indexes, a hashtable uses a key to lookup elements.
It then converts that key into an index to lookup in an array.

However, a common problem from this is that the conversion function results in collisions and to solve this issue there are various implementations of hashtables.
