To get to a sophisticated programming language we have to move from binary, which the machine knows to our abstract keywords which can signify any amount of keywords.

The process we use is boot strapping, this is so called because after we create one keyword from binary we can use that keyword to create the next ones.
Consequently, we are iteratively improving the scope of our programming language.
