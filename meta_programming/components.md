We want to convert a piece of text to something understandable by a computer.
To do this, we create structure :

	"5 * 5; 9 * 8;"

Can be structured so that we can break down the treatment of each piece into its own function. For example, this can be structured into something we call a component, this component is a sequence of components both of which are binary operations.

## Types
- Literal
- Name
- Expression
- Function
- Conditional
- Lambda
- Block
- Sequence
- Assignment
- Return
